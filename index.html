                <p>
                    Saliyha comes from a Jamaican immigrant background and has spent most of her life immersed in the 
                    multitude of diverse worlds of South Florida. In the times when distance threatened her connection 
                    to community, her sense of self, and understanding of her place in the world, she has always been 
                    able to find connection through her experiences volunteering and giving back to others.

                <p>
                    Her studies in Anthropology at The University of Notre Dame and her internship as an ethnographer at 
                    Bowman Creek Educational Ecosystem put her in a better position to understand how she could positively 
                    impact underrepresented communities and empower individuals.
                </p>
                <br>
                <p>
                    While Saliyha’s love for education, and enthusiasm for any novel experience has allowed her to wear 
                    many different hats throughout her brief career, her passion for community engagement, community 
                    empowerment, education, and environmental stewardship, and innovation has been her driving force.

                    Saliyha is partnered with Dream in Green, a local environmental nonprofit that works closely with schools,
                    businesses, and local governments to reduce their environmental footprint. Her role is to facilitate Water
                    Energy Learning and Behavior (WE-LAB) workshops to educate participants on ways to conserve water and 
                    energy, save money, and build environmental stewardship.

                <p>
                    She also works as the programs assistant at NAMI Miami-Dade. Here she assists in the coordination of 
                    free youth and adult educational programming in mental health and wellness furthering the mission to 
                    improve the quality of life for people with mental illness and their families through support, education, 
                    and advocacy.

                <p>
                    She received her education at the University of Notre Dame with a Bachelor’s in Anthropology with a 
                    particular focus on the subfield of Biological Anthropology and a minor in Italian studies. She has 
                    co-authored work published in <i> Collaborations</i> journal of University of Miami and
                    <i>Other Education - Journal of Educational Alternatives</i>.

                    She is currently studying web development as a part of the sixth Intro to G{Code} cohort. Saliyha is 
                    passionate about giving back to her community, and seeks to make a positive lasting impact. She is
                    excited to see how this opportunity to pursue a career in tech can affect that.
